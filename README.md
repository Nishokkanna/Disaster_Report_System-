# Disaster Response AI

A frontend-based AI-powered web application that aids in disaster response by analyzing uploaded images, detecting damage severity using the Google Cloud Vision API, and visualizing affected zones on an interactive Google Map.

## Features

- üéØ AI-based damage detection using Google Cloud Vision API
- üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Google Map showing live damage classification
- üè• Nearby emergency locations using Google Places API
- üîî Real-time browser push alerts using Notification API
- üíæ Local storage for saving disaster reports
- üì± Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Get your API keys:
   - Google Maps JavaScript API key (with Places API enabled)
   - Google Cloud Vision API key
3. Create a `js/config.js` file with your API keys:
   ```javascript
   const CONFIG = {
       GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY',
       GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_API_KEY: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_API_KEY'
   };
   ```
4. Replace the Google Maps API key in `index.html`:
   ```html
   <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY&libraries=places"></script>
   ```
5. Serve the application using a local web server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code)

## Usage

1. Allow location access when prompted to see nearby emergency services
2. Upload disaster images using the upload button or drag-and-drop
3. View AI analysis results and severity classification
4. Check the map for:
   - üî¥ Danger zones
   - üü° Moderate risk areas
   - üü¢ Safe zones
5. Enable notifications to receive alerts about new disaster reports
6. Click on emergency service markers to view details
